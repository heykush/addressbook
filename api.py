# #The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your existing Python3 skills and how you can
# create a minimal API using FastAPI.

#Create an address book application where API users can create, update and delete addresses.
# The address should:
# - contain the coordinates of the address.
# - be saved to an SQLite database.
# - be validated
# API Users should also be able to retrieve the addresses that are within a given distance and
# location coordinates.
# Important: The application does not need a GUI. (Built-in FastAPIâ€™s Swagger Doc is sufficient)

#The application should be written in Python 3.8 and use FastAPI.
# The application should be able to run on Linux and Windows.
